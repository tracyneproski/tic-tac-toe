# Odin Project Tic Tac Toe Game

# Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players 
# can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

# Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ 
# What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought 
# can save you from wasting an hour of coding.

# Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any 
# more than you have to.

    #puts "To exit game at any point, type 'exit'"
